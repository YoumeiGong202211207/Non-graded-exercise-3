    "Create a treasure hunt game where a user has to figure out the location of the treasure on a grid by using just the commands of E, W, N, and S, indicating East, West, North, and South, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "REQUIREMENTS:\n",
    "1. Define the size of the grid. It could be any number, but start from 5\n",
    "2. Assign the player a random position on the map. Do the same for the location of the treasure. (HINT: use randint() to generate a random set of coordinates)\n",
    "    2.1. Since it's 2-dimensional grid, the location of both the player and the treasure will be coordinates, like (x,y)\n",
    "3. Decide the maximum moves the player can make and keep track of the number of moves.\n",
    "4. Calculate the initial distance between the player and the treasure location\n",
    "5. Allow player to make as many moves as maximum moves allowed\n",
    "    5.1. Depending on which direction the player moves (N, S, E, or W), recalculate player's position and their distance from the treasure location\n",
    "    5.2. If the move brings player closer to the treasure, let the user know that they are getting closer\n",
    "    5.3. If the move takes player away from the treasure, let the user know that they are moving farther\n",
    "    5.4. If the player makes an illegal move, then let the user know that that move is not allowed. \n",
    "    5.5. If the new player position is the same as the treasure position, let the user know that they have found the treasure\n",
    "    5.6. If the moves made by the player are the same as maximum moves allowed, let the user know that no more moves are possible and that they have lost the game. Also show them where the treasure was located.\n",
    "    5.7. If there are still moves left, then the game should continue and keep asking the user for their moves. \n"

    "2. 在地图上给玩家分配一个随机位置。对宝藏的位置做同样的操作。(提示:使用randint()生成一个随机的坐标集合)\n",
    "2.1. 因为这是二维网格，所以玩家和宝藏的位置都是坐标，比如(x,y)\n",

    "5.3. 如果移动将玩家带离宝藏，让他们知道他们正在继续移动\n",

    "5.5. 如果新玩家的位置与宝藏位置相同，让用户知道他们已经找到了宝藏\n",
    "5.6. 如果玩家所下的步数与允许的最大步数相同，则让用户知道不可能再下更多步，他们已经输掉了游戏。也告诉他们宝藏的位置。\n",
    "5.7. 如果还有剩余的招数，那么游戏应该继续，不断询问用户的招数。\n",
